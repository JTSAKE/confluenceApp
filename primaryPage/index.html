    <h1 class="display-2 text-center">Welcome to Magellan</h1>
    <p class="text-center">Hello and welcome to Project Magellan! Ours is a mobile project &#40;Android/IOS&#41; and our client has given some stict performance requirements.</p>
    <h2 class="display-5">Expectations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Client Expectations is 3 bugs per day for each and every tester</li>
      <li>Lionbridge's expectation is 2 bugs per day for each and every tester</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Exceptions can and will be made based on tasking</li>
        <li>This is <strong>NOT</strong> a quota, merely an expectation for performance.</li>
        <li>It isn't the end of the world if these expectations aren't met every single day, but they are the minimum goal every tester should strive for.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-center"><u>Behavioral expectations are quite simple. They can be summed up with 4 rules.</u></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Be Civil</li>
      <ul>
        <li>We don't all need to be best friends, but we do need to work well together.</li>
        <li>Respect other people's perspectives, personalities, and interests; also be mindful of who and what is around us in the environment.</li>
        <li>Always do our best to be polite and patient with others.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Be Professional</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Remeber we are testing a multi-million dollar venture for our client with countless hours of work behind it from developers; we don't need to like th eproduct, but at the least respect it because none of us would have jobs without it.</li>
        <li>Always do our best to be patient with everyone and everything around us; this is a rough career for those lacking in patience.</li>
        <li>The language of bug write ups should be as objective as possible, detached from bias, judgement, harsh language, and personal feelings; a bug write up is just a report of what the bug is, how to reproduce it, and nothing more.</li>
        <li>Killing in lobbies should be done for self-defense <strong>only</strong>; killing bots is okay because they will shoot first, but killing other testers impedes their work.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Work Comes First</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Prioritize the roles and duties of the job over the fun social aspect that can be present<./li>
        <li>Employees are expected to report to work as scheduled, be on time an dbe prepared to start work. Employees are also expected to remain at work for their entire work schedule, except for meal or break periods, or when required to leave on authorized company business or other authorized reason. Schedules should be discussed and agreed upon by their supervisor, in accordance with business and client needs and expectations.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Have Fun</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Fun time is needed for a healthy and productive workspace, but it is still a workspace.</li>
        <li>We want everyone to have fun, but not as the expense of performance, quality, or other people.</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
